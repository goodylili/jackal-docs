# The Name Service Module

The RNS (Reverse Name Service) module is an essential component of the Jackal Protocol. It provides a user-friendly naming system for blockchain addresses.

The RNS module simplifies interacting with complex addresses by mapping them to human-readable names. This module allows users to transfer tokens and permissions to files/folders stored on the Jackal Protocol using human-readable names. It also forms the core of the referral program from the storage module.

### Overview

The RNS module manages the following aspects of the Reverse Name Service:

1. **Name Registration**: Allows users to register unique names for their blockchain addresses.
2. **Name Management**: Facilitates updating, renewing, and transferring RNS names.
3. **Name Resolution**: Provides a mechanism for resolving RNS names to their corresponding addresses.
4. **Name Sales**: Enables users to buy and sell RNS names through the RNS Marketplace.
5. **Name Transfers**: Enables users to transfer RNS names.
