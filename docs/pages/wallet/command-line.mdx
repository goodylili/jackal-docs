## Download and Install

First, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/releases) page on GitHub to download the binary for your system.

Execute the `canine` command to verify your installation.

```bash [Terminal]
canine
```

You should get the complete set of commands available on Canine if your installation is successful.


## Setting up an Account

You can create a new account with the `keys add` command :

```bash [Terminal]
canined keys add {account name}
```

If you have an existing account, add the `--recover` flag to add it.

```bash [Terminal]
canined keys add {account name} --recover
```

## Buying Storage

You can purchase storage with your account in the same vein. Execute this command to buy 1TB of storage for a month:


```bash [Terminal]
canined tx storage buy-storage $(canined keys show {account name} -a) 31 1099511627776 ujkl --from {account name} --gas-prices=0.02ujkl
```

In this case, `31` is 31 days, or one month, you can specify the days and amount of storage.

Here,  `1099511627776` is how many bytes you wish to purchase, this value is 1TiB, you can increase this or decrease this as you please.
