# Jackal Protocol: Actually Decentralized Storage

Jackal is a decentralized, highly-resistant, scalable storage for anyone, anywhere to persist and protect data. The Jackal Protocol uses both validators and storage providers to provide seamless access to all the [Jackal Protocol Modules](/blockchain/storage-module), including storage contracts and file structures.

Your data remains self custodial and no one! not even Jackal team members can access or view them. Just you and the chain!
